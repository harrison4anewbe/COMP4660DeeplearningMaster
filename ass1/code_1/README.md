Getting start

Make sure that the vehicle-x dataset located in the path where code exists.

1. Data preprocessing
Make sure that the vehicle-x dataset located in the path where code exists. Running the dataprocess.py, which generates 6 files in this path which will be used in training and testing.
2. Run code
In this paper, we establish 3 models for comparison which save as twolayerNet.py, tree.py, and maxlikelihood.py corresponding to the neural network, decision tree, and maximum likelihood respectively. 
Each program will train and test automatically. The output will be the accuracy for train-set and test-set.
