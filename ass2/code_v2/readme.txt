Getting start

Make sure that the vehiclexV2 dataset located in the path where code exists.

1. Data preprocessing
Make sure that the vehicle-x dataset located in the path where code exists. Running the DataPreprocessing.py , which generates 3 files in this path which will be used in training and testing.
2. Run code
In this paper, we establish a deep convolutional neural network for classification. This program will train and test automatically. The output will be the accuracy for train-set and test-set, and a loss plot.
